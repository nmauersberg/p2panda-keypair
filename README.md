# Using p2panda with webpack leads to the following error:

```
Uncaught Error: Could not generate new key pair: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'keypair_new')
```

## To reproduce, clone this repo and run `yarn serve`

I noticed this issue, when I tried to use p2panda in Next.js or a React webapp.
